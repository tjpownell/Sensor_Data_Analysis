# Sensor_Data_Analysis
###  This repository is where I develop and test data formatting for sensor and controller feedback.
> The code is geared for quick and easy analysis of .csv files or .xlsx files collected from testing setups.
> You will need to checkout the code to your local host, and edit the file path callout of the panda data frame declaration in order to get started with your own data.
### Most of my current work relates to CAN serial bus data manipulation.
#### However, the application of these scripts should be adaptable to any time dependent system with sensor feedback integrated into a controller architecture.
